## Ecosystem (trdlabs)

This repository is part of the `trdlabs` trading ecosystem.

**Before planning or coding, read `../control-center/` when the task involves:**
- other repositories, system architecture, or integration boundaries
- API, MCP, SDK, or contract changes
- rollout, migration, or cross-repo validation
- local development, Docker, running the full ecosystem stack, or mock-platform data intervals
- fetching a new VPS snapshot and making it the ecosystem default fixture

**Read order when triggered:**
1. `../control-center/repos.yaml`
2. `../control-center/AGENTS.md`
3. `../control-center/repos/trading-platform-sdk.md`
4. `../control-center/docs/operations/local-development.md` when starting or debugging the local stack
5. `../control-center/docs/operations/mock-platform-data.md` when historical intervals (1m/1h/1d) or mock fixtures matter
6. `../control-center/docs/operations/mock-platform-snapshot-rollout.md` when ingesting a VPS slice or changing the default fixture across repos
7. `../control-center/ecosystem-defaults.yaml` and skill `mock-snapshot-default-rollout` when making a VPS slice the ecosystem default

If `../control-center` is absent (standalone clone), use local repo docs only.

Repository-specific commands and boundaries: `AGENTS.md` in this repository.
